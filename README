The main reason of developing this addon is giving ability to Persian bloggers (who blog about politics, society & other things that government doesn't like) to migrate their weblog to global services like blogger/wordpress, so bloggers can write without being worried about that their IP would be given to the government by weblog provider. also they can make backup of their weblog to use it when their weblog got closed by service provider or got banned by government.

addon is modular so any other weblog systems without export tool could be added.
